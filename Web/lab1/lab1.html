                        Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biːˈjɒnseɪ/; born September 4, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, actress
                        and activist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. Beyoncé rose
                        to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of the R&B girl-group Destiny's Child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups in history. Their hiatus
                        saw Beyoncé's theatrical film debut in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) and the release of her
                        debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned
                        five Grammy Awards, and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby
                        Boy".

                        Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as "one of the most compelling
                        instruments in popular music".
                    </p>
                    <p> Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. Jon Pareles of The
                        New York Times commented that her voice is "velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves
                        of soul belting". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal
                        style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.
                    </p>
                    <p> Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was "capable
                        of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars."

                        Beyoncé started a relationship with Jay-Z after their collaboration on "'03 Bonnie & Clyde", which appeared on his seventh
                        album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002). Beyoncé appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the
                        music video for the song, fuelling speculation about their relationship. On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé
                        and Jay-Z married without publicity. As of April 2014, the couple had sold a combined 300 million
                        records together. They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become
                        more relaxed in recent years.
                    </p>
                    <p> On February 1, 2017 she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement
                        gained 6,335,571 "likes" within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on
                        the website at the time. On July 13, 2017, Beyoncé uploaded the first image of herself and the
                        twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017
                        and the names Rumi and Sir Carter. The twins were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center
                        in California. Rumi, the daughter, was born before Sir, the son.

                   The reality is: sometimes you lose.
                   And you’re never too good to lose.
                   You’re never too big to lose.
                   You’re never too smart to lose.
                   It happens.
                </pre>

                    I truly believe that women should be financially independent from their men.
                    And let’s face it, money gives men the power to run the show.
                    It gives men the power to define value.
                    They define what’s sexy.
                    And men define what’s feminine.
                    It’s ridiculous.

                    We all have our imperfections.
                    But I’m human, and you know,
                    it’s important to concentrate on other qualities besides outer beauty.
